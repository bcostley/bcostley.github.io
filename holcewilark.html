      <tr><td><img src="holceth.jpg" alt="Holce Trailhead" width=500></td><td><p>The Holce trailhead is at the end of Knott St. in Vernonia. Officially the CZ trail continues to the mill pond and then to Anderson Park, but this is the end of the continous portion of the trail from the Scappoose end.</p><p>Perhaps hard to tell in the picture is steepness of the trail at this end. The first part of the trail is about a 25% grade. This flattens out after a bit before getting steep again. All in all, the first 1/3 mile is about a 14% grade on average. This portion is paved.</p><p>The trail turns to gravel and continues up finally flattening (but still up) around 0.4 miles from the trailhead.</p></td></tr>
      <tr><td><img src="saddlemt.jpg" alt="Saddle Mountain" width=500></td><td><p>Clearcuts to the west open up a view of Saddle Mountain, Green Mountain, and Elk Mountain in the flattest part of this whole segment.</p></td></tr>
      <tr><td><img src="summit.jpeg" alt="Summit of segment" width=500></td><td><p>At about 1.25 miles in the trail reaches the summit of this section. This makes for a good turnaround spot.</p><p>You may continue to the Wilark trailhead. If so, the trail will go down. Then down. Followed by down. If you don't have a shuttle, remember that on the way back, this will be a relentless up, up, up.</p></td></tr>
      <tr><td><img src="czview.jpeg" alt="view" width=500></td><td><p>This stretch of trail does have this nice view. Just before you reach the trailhead about 2.45 miles from the Holce TH, the trail flattens and crosses Elk Creek and this segment ends with a paring area.</p></td></tr>
