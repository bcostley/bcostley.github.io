<h1>Mr. Costley's Class Library</h1>
<p>Reading has been shown to be very beneficial to people for numerous reasons including increasing vocabulary, knowlwedge, and general well-being.</p>
<p>To support reading, I have a small library in my class for use during advisory and other times when a student might have an opportunity to read.</p>
<p>This library consists of my own books, most of which I have read. Students should treat the books with respect and return them in the same condition as they came.</p>
<p>To respect the parent/guardian right to determine what materials are appropriate for their students, parents may at any time deny access to any or all of the books in my library.</p>
<p>Please review <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jSV4pd1UuUUd9n09rzBOCF5rjl6VxT5Pc50x4jr9kdQ/edit?usp=sharing">Costley's Class Library<a></a></a></p>
<p>I will keep this list up to date. If you desire to deny permission or have any questions, please <a href="mailto:bcostley@vernoniak12.org">email me</a></a> or call me at 503-429-1385</a></p>
