<h1>Mr. Costley's Class Library and Permission</h1>
<p>Reading has been shown to be very beneficial to people for numerous reasons including increasing vocabulary, knowlwedge, and general well-being.</p>
<p>To support reading, I have a small library in my class for use during advisory and other times when a student might have an opportunity to read.</p>
<p>Due to controversy nationally, I need parent/guardian permission for access to my classroom libray. This may be a blanket permission or a book by book permission. If giving blanket permission, please note that the library may be updated at any time.</p>
<p>Please review <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jSV4pd1UuUUd9n09rzBOCF5rjl6VxT5Pc50x4jr9kdQ/edit?usp=sharing">Costley's Class Library<a></a></a></p>
<p>If you desire to grant permission, please return a copy of the above link with your student's name, your signature, and your printed name.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, you may <a href="mailto:bcostley@vernoniak12.org">email me</a></a> or call me at 503-429-1385</a></p>
