      <tr><td><img src="mile19.jpg" alt="Mile 19 sign and trail" width=500></td><td><p>The trail starts flat and moves away from the highway and soon crosses the East Fork Nehalem River and comes to an intersection. GO right to stay on the CZ trail (left is a Weyerhauser logging road).</p></td></tr>
      <tr><td><img src="camp8.jpg" alt="Camp 8 sign" width=500></td><td><p>This area used to be a logging camp. The trail here begins going mostly up though at an easy grade.</p></td></tr>
      <tr><td><img src="floeterTH.jpg" alt="Floeter Trailhead" width=500></td><td><p>Keep on walking. The trail parallels ScapV highway this entire segement but for the first 2/3s is far enough away you might not notice if traffic is light.</p><p>This segment ends at the Floeter trailhead.</p></td></tr>
