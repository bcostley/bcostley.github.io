    <p>The Vernonia Mill Pond (officially Vernonia Lake) was build for the Oregon-American Mill which was in operation in the early to mid-20th century in Vernonia. The mill closed down when the old growth was all cut. The mill pond and some structures, notably the walls of the fuel building, remain.</p>

    <p>This is an easy paved walk around the pond. This is a good walk for birdwatching with bald eagles, osprey, herons, ducks, and redwinged blackbirds among others.</p>
    <p>Blackberries line much of the path making for a treat in early fall. There is a swingset near the parking. Fishing is popular around the pond from the banks and from two docks.</p>
    <p>In season, Calypso's vends ice cream, hamburgers, and hot dogs.</p>
    <p>A primitive campground is adjacent to the path.</p>
    <p><a href="webbway.html">Webb Way</a> connects the mill pond to Anderson Park near downtown Vernonia.</p>
